My projects on GitHub are more like a tutorial than a finished product: [bestia-dev tutorials](https://github.com/bestia-dev/tutorials_rust_wasm).

## Motivation

GitHub can deny me access to my repositories at any moment without any warning. Look what happened to Iranian developers because the USA is in argument with Iran. Microsoft (the owner of GitHub) must comply with USA law and they denied access to many Iranian developers without warning. It can happen any day to anybody for any reason without explanation or recurse. Very concerning!

Sure I don't want to have all my eggs in one basket. I need to make a backup of all my repositories. I should automate this. It is just bash scripts I run in `Windows git-bash`.

## GitHub backup folders

My GitHub backup folders are in my DropBox folder:  
`d:\Dropbox\BestiaDev\github_backup_active\` and  
`d:\Dropbox\BestiaDev\github_backup_archived\`  

This way they got synchronized to my DropBox automatically. To be sure I also make a backup of the DropBox folder to my 2 external disks regularly.

## git-bash scripts

On Win10 I have installed `git` and with it comes `git-bash`. It is fantastic that I can use bash scripts in Windows. It makes my life so much easier.

In this repository, there are copies of these scripts in folders just like I have them in my DropBox folder.


## Open-source and free as a beer

My open-source projects are free as a beer (MIT license).  
I just love programming.  
But I need also to drink. If you find my projects and tutorials helpful, please buy me a beer by donating to my [PayPal](https://paypal.me/LucianoBestia).  
You know the price of a beer in your local bar ;-)  
So I can drink a free beer for your health :-)
